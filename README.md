# Basic-Agent-trafic-stuck
The aim is to generate data from Netlogo and feed it to a LSTM to learn predicting trafic crisis. 

You can Try :

Variate rNbre and yNbre , compute differente ratios.

Find out what are the conditions or factors that make circulation stops inside lhdim ??â€”- figure out Blocage data matrix (Ln are numeric data , C are labels such as yNbre nd rNbre ratio or Total turtle numbers)) // convert to flow ratio // maybe play with section width.

Count individual ticks (affect it to age OWN) and compute average age / then constraint the model to the selective pressure of the ageVStarget reaching . add heat map the patches .

Generate CSV Data format to load as Data Frame (ex : pandas with Python) then play code Machine learning model to predict circulation crisis under conditions offered by Netlogo World.
